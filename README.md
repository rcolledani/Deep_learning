# deep_learning
Non-exhaustive Deep-Learning projects I worked on

1- Nuclei_segmentation_classification : The aim of this project was to use deep neural networks to segment and classify nuclei images.
2- Grad_CAM : the aim of this project was to implement a grad cam on a VQA_resnet model in order to identify which part of the image impacted the most the answer of the VQA model
3- GraphNN : The aim of this project was to use GraphNN to classify Protein-protein interactions. 
4- Transfert_learning : The aim of this project was to use transfert learning and moreover to deal with problems with small amount of data.
